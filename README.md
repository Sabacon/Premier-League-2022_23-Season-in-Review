## Premier-League-2022_23-Season-in-Review

In this notebook I take a look at `English Premier League` data from the `2022/2023` season. The data is available on Kaggle. 

More than anything, this was a way to practice my `data wrangling` skills using `Pandas`. Plus the chance to play around with data about a sport and a league that I am absolutely crazy about was simply too good to pass up.

You are welcome to tag along.
